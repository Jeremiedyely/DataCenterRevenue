Assumptions:

1. Revenue Definition
MRR represents recurring monthly charges per contract for racks and reserved power, as defined
by contract terms. MRR is calculated at the client-contract level and aggregated across clients.
One-time fees, credits, and usage overages are excluded. Contract-defined MRR is reconciled to
invoiced recurring revenue in the ERP.

2. Revenue Timing
Revenue is recognized in the invoice posting month. Contract amendments apply from their
effective start date. Mid-month changes are not prorated.

3. Contract Structure
Each contract defines racks entitled, reserved power (kW), and pricing rules. Contract changes
create a new contract version.

4. Usage Measurement
Primary usage metric is average daily used kW aggregated monthly. Peak daily used kW is
reported for risk visibility. Usage is evaluated within contract-defined limits.

5. Late or Missing Data
Late meter readings are backfilled within 7 days. Missing readings beyond 7 days are marked
estimated and excluded from control sign-off.

6. Power Cost Allocation
Monthly power cost is allocated based on metered usage share. Estimated costs are true-up
adjusted when actuals arrive.

7. Margin Calculation
Gross margin equals revenue minus allocated power cost. Other operating costs are excluded.
8. Controls & Thresholds
ERP vs mart revenue variance threshold is ±1%. Variance root causes include timing, mapping,
missing data, and late data
