Failure Modes & Mitigations

- Late meter data → Backfill logic with reprocessing timestamp
- Contract amendments → Versioned contracts with effective dates
- Duplicate contract/customer IDs → Surrogate keys + standardized joins
- Estimated vs actual usage → True-up adjustment at close

Purpose: make revenue, cost, and margin failures visible, explainable, and controllable.
